# Windows 10 Toolbox GUI
UPDATE: Total re write.. built from scratch as the previous gui was trash..

This is no where near finished, but it is the same concept as my Batch Script Toolbox, but it is incorporated 
with a basic Visual Studio C# App.

This is my first C# Anything so there will most likely be errors and ways I can optimize my code.



Screen of the main Window: As you can see, Basic and not finished.. but SOON! :)
