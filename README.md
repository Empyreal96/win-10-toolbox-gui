# Windows 10 Toolbox GUI
This is no where near finished, but it is the same concept as my Batch Script Toolbox, but it is incorporated 
with a basic Visual Studio C# App.



This is my first C# Anything so there will most likely be errors and ways I can optimize my code.



Screen of the main Window: As you can see, Basic and not finished.. but SOON! :)
